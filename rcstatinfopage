rrdtool degrade times:
10s  -> 16.26hrs
40s  -> 9.33days
400s -> 244days

Common things to look for:
1. Free memory goes to zero
2. CPU use at zero for all nodes

Empty Graphs (not graphs with data at zero)? nan Values?
It's likely Ganglia wasn't taking data at the time. It's very unlikely that the node was down.
